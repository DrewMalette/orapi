	SaGa sci-fi
	
	You're sort of a merc
	
	Start in Outpost Overwood (apartments, shops, bank)
	
	If you want to live in a shelter (better sleep) you either need to rent an apartment,
	buy a house/condo, get a tent and live in the woods (better sleep but not as good as in
	a house, plus there will be random encounters during the night).
	
	You have to pay taxes every year. You also get a bank account and you collect interest.
	You can also play the lottery (and win). Grand prize: 1.5 million credits.
	
	There are quests for money and other rewards.
	
	You also have to pay for a cell phone. You don't *need* a cell phone but if you want
	one you have to pay for it monthly. A phone is 400 credits and costs 40 credits per month
	for access.
	
	You'll also need to eat, so you'll need groceries or money for a meal at a restaurant.
